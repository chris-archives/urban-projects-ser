            <h1>THE MISSION</h1>
            <p>The mission of Urban Projects: Sports Equipment Redistribution is to repurpose old sports equipment and put it in the hands of middle and elementary students in the Philadelphia School District. We hope to enhance and encourage athletic participation at a young age and provide the necessary equipment for this to happen.</p>

                    <p>Future Goals - Our main goal is to become a 501c3 Nonprofit organization by the end of 2024. We hope to continue our outreach with collections from numerous organizations and high schools with old equipment and redistribute it to new schools across the city that are in need.</p>
